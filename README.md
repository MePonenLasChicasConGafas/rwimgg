- [waifu.pics](https://waifu.pics)
- [waifu.im](https://waifu.im)

All credits of images to their respectful owners, thank you `waifu.pics` and `waifu.im` for making such a great API.

## Why are you making this?

:)

## Has been written in:
- [x] Deno
- [x] Node
- [x] Python
- [ ] Nim????
- [ ] ARDUINO????

Please suggest what languages for this script to be written in, or write this script in other languages.

## How to run?

obviously download the project to your machine, and run the scripts.

The dates besides the names indicate their creation date.

### Deno [23/1/31]

Deno does not require you to download anything (YAYYY) so just run this, add the `--nsfw` flag at the end to print out nsfw images.
```
deno run --allow-all https://raw.githack.com/MePonenLasChicasConGafas/rwimgg/main/DENO/index.ts
```
THERE MIGHT BE SOME ERRORS OF FILES NOT BEING SUPPORTED THAT IS NORMAL

### Node [23/02/01]

Make sure that the terminal is a good size or else the image will be small.
1. Download this, go to the `NODE` folder and open a terminal.
2. run `npm install`
3. run `node index.js`, you can use the `--nsfw` flag to get nsfw results.

### Python [22/??/??]

To run use `python main.py` add the flag `--nsfw=true`.

You might not have some libraries, so to install them run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
